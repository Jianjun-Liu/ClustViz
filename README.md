# CLUSTERING VISUALIZATION
Visualising clustering algorithms step by step

The aim of this project is to visualize every step of each clustering algorithm, in the case of 2D input data.

The following algorithms have been examined:
- OPTICS
- DBSCAN
- HDBSCAN
- SPECTRAL CLUSTERING
- HIERARCHICAL AGGLOMERATIVE CLUSTERING
  - single linkage
  - complete linkage
  - average linkage
  - Ward's method
- CURE
- BIRCH
- PAM
- CLARA
- CLARANS
- CHAMELEON
- CHAMELEON2
